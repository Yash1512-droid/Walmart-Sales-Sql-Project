# Walmart-Sales-Sql-Project
This project analyzes Walmartâ€™s sales dataset using SQL. The goal is to uncover key business insights by working with real-world retail data. I used SQL queries to explore, clean, and analyze the dataset. The analysis focuses on sales performance, holiday impact, trends, and store-wise performance.
